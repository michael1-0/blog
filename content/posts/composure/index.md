Do you truly have control of yourself?

What does it really mean to stay composed, even when emotions surge?

A week ago, I watched the first installment of [Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba â€“ The Movie: Infinity Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_%E2%80%93_The_Movie:_Infinity_Castle) at the cinema.

There was this term, **Selfless State**, where the main character needed to tap in, in order to access the **Transparent World**, and generally overcome the villain.

To achieve **Selfless State**, one needs to have a mind clear of all unnecessary thoughts and emotions. That means the main character needed to extinguish overwhelming emotions such as anger, and hatred towards that villain.

Getting rid of those emotions made the main character think more clearly.

In the end, the main character did so, I won't get into much more detail about what happened.

The same concept applies to us.

When we do something that makes us feel uncomfortable in a way, we tend to lose our composure. Be it accidental or not; it leads us to making unwise decisions.

When we feel emotions such as anger towards something/someone, we throw our emotions into something/someone.

We have the right to be mad about it, but we also need to realize that everything we do as humans has reasons we might not know. No matter how wrong they sound, it's a reason of their own. Consequences will follow naturally.

To see people not as one-dimensional villains, but as complex beings.

If you can't understand their reasons, it's okay.

This applies to our own thoughts as well.

What we can do is to keep our composure, don't let any bother us.

After all, we have our own reasons.
